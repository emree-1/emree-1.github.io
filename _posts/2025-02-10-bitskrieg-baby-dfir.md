**Flag : BITSCTF{a_really_simple_intro_to_DFIR_12848a9e}**

## Ressources

For this challenge, we are given a `.ad1` file named `abc.ad1`.

> **.ad1 file type**  
> An `.ad1` file is an image format used by AccessData's `FTK Imager tool`. It is a proprietary forensic image format that allows for the preservation of the exact state of a storage device, including all file system structures and unallocated space. These images are commonly used in digital forensics to capture the contents of a disk or other storage media for further analysis, maintaining both the integrity and completeness of the data.
{: .prompt-tip}

## Tools 

In this challenge, as we have a `.ad1` file, we will need [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads/ftk-imager-4-7-3-81) to analyse it.   
`FTK Imager` is a powerful forensic imaging tool developed by AccessData, widely used in digital forensics to create exact, bit-for-bit copies of storage devices and thoroughly analyze the contents of these images.

## Walkthrough

### Installing FTK Imager

The first step is to install `FTK Imager`. Since we are working with a proprietary forensic image format, it is essential to use the correct software to properly analyze it.

You can install `FTK Imager` from [Exterro's website](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads/ftk-imager-4-7-3-81). 

### Opening the ad1 file

Once `FTK Imager` is installed, you can begin opening the `.ad1` file. To do so, go to the options bar at the top of the application, click on `File`, and then select `Add Evidence Item...`.

Next, choose `Image file` as we are working with a `.ad1` image that needs to be analyzed.

To confirm that the file has been successfully loaded, check the evidence tree on the left. You should now see the newly added evidence entries.

### Reading the flag

We're almost done with the challenge! The only step left is to explore the evidence tree a little further. You will (very) quickly come across a `flag.txt` file. After clicking on it, its contents will appear at the bottom of the window, revealing the actual flag.

## Conclusion

As mentioned in the description, this challenge was relatively straightforward, requiring no advanced analysis or specialized knowledge â€” simply using the right tool was enough.
