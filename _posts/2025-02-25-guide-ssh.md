## Introduction

Hey everybody, I hope you are doing well! I haven't shared any writeups or tools recently as I am spending some times searching for an internship. By the way if you need a cyber enthusiast with some technical skills let me know!

Anyways, recently I have decided to improve my technical knowledge and pawn skilled, so I have naturally decided to learn more about ELF  binary exploition. This guide is the first one of a serie I would like to do about ELF exploitation technics. My goal is not to explain only the exploitation part, but go deeper in how Linux works, and see how it could be exploited. 

For this guide, I would like to start from start, and analyse how Linux executes a program. Basically, how a program goes from a file containing some machine code, to an executable loaded into memory, mapped through several segments. So let's dive into it!
