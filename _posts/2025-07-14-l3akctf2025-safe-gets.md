**Flag : L3AK{6375_15_4pp4r3n7ly_n3v3r_54f3}$**

## Ressources

For this challenge, we are given a `.zip` archive containing a repository with two main files:
- `chall`: an **ELF binary** we are expected to exploit.
- `wrapper.py`: as its name suggests, a **Python script** that acts as a wrapper to execute the binary.

## Tools 

For this challenge, I will rely heavily on `gdb` to analyze the binaryâ€™s execution flow. For exploit development, Iâ€™ll use the well-known `pwntools` library, a powerful toolkit that greatly simplifies exploit scripting.

Other than that, weâ€™ll mostly rely on our ***brain*** and **pwn knowledge**. Fortunately, Iâ€™ll explain each step in detail so anyone can follow along and learn from this challenge.

## Resolution

### Initial Analysis 

Letâ€™s begin with a quick look at `wrapper.py`:

```py
import subprocess
import sys

BINARY = "./chall"
MAX_LEN = 0xff

# Get input from user
payload = input(f"Enter your input (max {MAX_LEN} bytes): ")
if len(payload) > MAX_LEN:
    print("[-] Input too long!")
    sys.exit(1)

# Start the binary with pipes
proc = subprocess.Popen(
    [BINARY],
    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
    stdout=sys.stdout,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE
)

try:
    # Send initial payload
    proc.stdin.write(payload.encode() + b'\n')
    proc.stdin.flush()

    # Interactive loop
    while True:
        line = sys.stdin.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        if proc.poll() is not None:
            print("[+] Process has exited.")
            break
        proc.stdin.write(line.encode('latin1'))
        proc.stdin.flush()
except (KeyboardInterrupt, BrokenPipeError):
    print("[+] Exiting.")
finally:
    try:
        proc.terminate()
    except Exception:
        pass
```

Hereâ€™s what the `wrapper` does:
1. Launches a **subprocess** running the `./chall` binary.
2. Prompts the user for **input**.
3. Checks that the user **input length** is less than a defined `MAX_LEN`, which is set to `255` (`0xFF`).
4. Forwards the input to the `./chall` process.
5. Closes the process and exits.

As expected, the wrapper serves primarily to enforce a **size constraint** on the user input before sending it to the actual binary. The core logic of the challenge lies in the `./chall` binary.

To start analyzing the binary, we first use the `file` command to identify its type and then `checksec` to assess its security mitigations.

```bash 
file chall

chall: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interprete
r /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=069a626803609321a7ec8d5c1d5dd218b3f7939a, for GNU
/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

This output confirms that `chall` is a **64-bit dynamically linked ELF executable**. The most important detail here is that the binary is **not stripped**, meaning it retains its symbol table â€” *function and variable names havenâ€™t been removed*. This is great news for rev and debugging, as weâ€™ll be able to read function names directly in tools like `gdb`.

Next, we run `checksec` to examine the binaryâ€™s security features:

```bash 
checksec --file=chall

RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX          PIE     RPATH     RUNPATH     Symbols ...          
Partial RELFO   No canary found   NX enabled  No PIE  No RPATH  No RUNPATH  38 symbols ...
```

Letâ€™s break this down:
- **RELRO (Relocation Read-Only)**: Only partially enabled, so the GOT (Global Offset Table) is still writable.
- **Stack Canary**: Not present, meaning thereâ€™s **no protection** against simple **stack-based buffer overflows**.
- **NX (No-eXecute)**: Enabled â€” this prevents execution on the stack, but not a blocker for Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).
- **PIE (Position Independent Executable)**: Disabled â€” this means the binary is loaded at a **fixed address**, which is great for exploitation as we can hardcode addresses without needing to leak memory.

In short, weâ€™re dealing with a *relatively unprotected binary*: no **stack canary**, **no PIE**. This makes it a good candidate for classic buffer overflow. In a future article, I might delve deeper into each of these security mitigations and their impact on binary exploitation.

### Dynamic Analysis

Now that weâ€™ve understood the general structure of the challenge, itâ€™s time to see how the `chall` binary behaves at runtime. For that, letâ€™s simply execute it and observe its behavior:

![Video of me trying to feed some inputs to the chall binary to test it.](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/testing_chall_binary.gif)

From this quick test, it becomes clear that the program **reverses the input string**: the first character becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

### Static analysis

Time to bring out the heavy tools. Letâ€™s load the binary into `Ghidra` and explore its code. From the function list, two functions stand out:
- `main()`: the entry point containing the core logic.
- `win()`: a suspiciously named function that likely holds the key to capturing the flag.

#### win()

Letâ€™s start with `win()` since itâ€™s short and easy to analyze

![win() function in Ghidra](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/win_function.png){: w="250"}

This function doesnâ€™t do much: it simply **spawns a shell** by executing `/bin/sh`. Thatâ€™s a strong indication that this function is our target â€” if we manage to redirect execution flow to `win()`, weâ€™ll likely be able to retrieve the flag manually from a shell session.

#### main()

Now letâ€™s focus on the `main()` function, which implements the input handling and reversal behavior we observed during dynamic analysis.

![main() function in Ghidra, not cleaned](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/main_function.png)

We can already recognize some patterns here: input is read into a variable, its length is computed, and a for loop performs processing â€” which we now suspect is the **string reversal**.

Based on this observation, itâ€™s safe to assume that `local_118` (Ghidraâ€™s default naming for local variables) is the **user-provided input**, and the reversal happens inside the loop.

Letâ€™s clean up the decompiled code to better understand the logic:

![main() function after cleaning](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/main_function_cleaned.png)

You see it, I saw it, we all saw it: the infamous `gets()` function. The binary is literally asking us to exploit it. `gets()` is notoriously unsafe: it reads user input into a buffer **without checking if the input fits**, leading directly to **buffer overflows**.

<details class="my_details" markdown="1">

---   

**Whatâ€™s wrong with `gets()`**

The `gets()` function reads input from `stdin` into a buffer, but doesnâ€™t check the size of the buffer. That means if the user sends more data than the buffer can hold, the function will keep writing â€” **overwriting adjacent variables** or **even the return address** of the function on the stack.

This vulnerability is called a **buffer overflow**, and it's one of the most classic exploitation vectors in binary exploitation. Iâ€™m planning to publish a dedicated article on this topic soon, so stay tuned!
</details>

So we want to be able to overwrite the return adress that is placed at the begin of the stack to write in it the adresse of the `win()` so that we jump to it instead. To do so, we need to overwrite the complete buffer allocate for the `user_message` AND the space for `RBP`.

What we need to do is clear: **overwrite the return address stored on the stack so that it points to the `win()` function**. This means we must:
1. Overflow the buffer allocated for the user input.
2. Overwrite the saved base pointer (`RBP`).
3. Overwrite the saved return address with the address of `win()`.

Letâ€™s figure out how many bytes we need to reach the return address. To get the size of `user_message` we can look at the assembly code from Ghidra:  

![main() function's start in assembly](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/main_assembly.png)  

<details class="my_details" markdown="1">

**What does this assembly tell us?**

One line in particular is important:

```
sub    rsp, 0x110
```

This instruction subtracts `0x110` (`272` in decimal) from the stack pointer (`RSP`), effectively **allocating 272 bytes on the stack** for local variables.

Why are we subtracting instead of adding? Because of how the stack works: its current top is tracked by the `RSP` register, and **the stack grows downward in memory** â€” *from higher addresses to lower ones*. So, subtracting from `RSP` effectively allocates more space on the stack by moving the stack pointer to a lower memory address.

This memory reservation likely corresponds to the buffer used for storing user input. So in C, this would be equivalent to:
```c
char user_message[259];  // 259 bytes
```

Why `272` and not `259`? Because compilers often add padding to maintain **stack alignment** â€” typically a multiple of 16 bytes â€” which explains the discrepancy. The remaining 13 bytes are likely padding for alignment purposes.
</details>

BUT! Remember the wrapper?

Earlier we saw that `wrapper.py` limits user input to a maximum length of **255 bytes**, enforced before the binary even receives it. But we just determined that we need to send **at least 280 bytes** to reach the return address.

So hereâ€™s the real challenge: *how can we bypass the Python wrapperâ€™s input length restriction to send a longer payload and exploit the buffer overflow?*

### Python emoji attack ðŸ—¿

Thereâ€™s something quite amusing (and exploitable) about how Python's `len()` function works with emojis. You might expect it to count the **number of bytes** an emoji uses â€” but instead, it counts the **number of grapheme clusters** (visual characters).

So, the emoji "ðŸ—¿" is counted as **1 character** by `len()`, even though it's actually **4 bytes** when encoded in UTF-8.

Letâ€™s demonstrate that with a small Python snippet:

```py 
user_message = input("Enter your message: ")

print("Size from len function: ", len(user_message))
print("Size after encode:", len(user_message.encode()))
```

![Demo of the python emoji attack](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/python_emoji_attack_demo.gif){: w="300"}

As shown in the demo, `len()` returns `1`, while `len(...encode())` gives `4` â€” *the true size in bytes*. And now the fun part: we can use this quirk to bypass the length check in `wrapper.py`, and still send enough bytes to trigger a buffer overflow.

Hereâ€™s the idea:

```py
# 70 * 4 = 280 bytes, exactly what we need.

payload = "ðŸ—¿"*70 # + ret_address + win_address (still to be determined)
```

This bypasses the `len(input) < 255` check in the Python wrapper while still sending `280 bytes` to the underlying binary. Perfect!

BUT *(yes, another one)*: remember that the binary reverses our input before using it. Thatâ€™s a *huge problem*.   

If we send a nicely crafted payload with a fake return address followed by the address of the `win()` function, the binary will reverse it â€” and our exploit will be completely messed up. Instead of jumping to `win()`, it will jump to garbage. Unlessâ€¦

### Exploiting strlen()

Hereâ€™s the *clever trick*. Letâ€™s take a closer look at how the reversing is done:
1. The program first calls `strlen()` on the user input.
2. It uses the result to iterate over the input in a for loop, and reverse it.

So, what if `strlen()` returns `0`? Then the loop wonâ€™t run â€” and the input wonâ€™t be reversed. Which meansâ€¦ we can send a payload without it being reversed and corrupted.

Now, how does `strlen()` work? It simply walks through memory, counting bytes **until it encounters a null byte** (`\x00`), which it treats as the end of the string. So if we start our payload with a null byte, `strlen()` will return `0` â€” and the reversing loop will be skipped entirely. We can craft the payload like this:

```python
# Total needed: 280 bytes
# ðŸ—¿ = 4 bytes, so 69 emojis = 276 bytes
# Add 1 null byte + 3 padding bytes ('A') = 280

payload = b"\x00" + "ðŸ—¿"*69 + b"A"*3 # + ret_adress + win_adress
```

By placing the null byte at the beginning, the length reported by `strlen()` becomes `0` â€” so no **reversal occurs**. The rest of the payload *(emojis + padding + addresses)* remains untouched in memory.

### Finding the adress of win()

Weâ€™re almost there. All we need now are two **key addresses**:   
- The **address of the `win()`** function (our target).
- The **address of a `ret`** instruction (used for alignment).

Since the binary is **not stripped** and **PIE is disabled**, addresses remain constant, and we can easily retrieve them using `gdb`.

Letâ€™s start by getting the **address of `win()`**:

![Getting the adress of the win function using GDB](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/getting_win.gif){: w="350"}

So `win()` is at `0x401262`. Next, we search for a **`ret` instruction**. These are usually found at the end of functions â€” so letâ€™s check inside `main()`:

![Getting the adress of the ret instruction inside the main function using GDB](/assets/img/l3akctf/pwn/safe_gets/getting_ret.gif){: w="500"}

We found a `ret` at `0x401261`. Now that we have both addresses, weâ€™re ready to build the **final payload** and **write the exploit script** using `pwntools`.

<details class="my_details" markdown="1">
---
**Why do we need a ret?**  

When using gadgets like `win()`, depending on the system and calling convention, we may need to adjust the stack for proper alignment. In 64-bit Linux, the `ret` gadget is often used to align the stack correctly before jumping to a function.
</details>

### Final Exploit

```py
from pwn import *

# Local version
# elf = context.binary = ELF("./chall")
# p = process()

# Remote version
p = remote("34.45.81.67", 16002)
p.recvuntil(b't (max 255 bytes):')

ret_address = p64(0x401261)
win_address = p64(0x401262)

payload = b"\x00" + "ðŸ—¿".encode() * 69 + b"A" * 3 + ret_address + win_address

p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
``` 

When you launch the **exploit**, a shell is spawned. From there, you can simply list the contents of the directory and retrieve the flag file.

## Conclusion

This was by far the **longest writeup Iâ€™ve written**. I know most writeups tend to be much shorter and go straight to the point, but Iâ€™ve **often found myself lost** when reading writeups that **skip over key explanations**. Thatâ€™s why I chose to over-explain things â€” so even someone new to binary exploitation or CTFs can follow along and learn something.

I was also surprised by how hard it is to write a good pwn writeup. When you're trying to explain whatâ€™s going on, itâ€™s easy to get **sidetracked into deep technical rabbit holes**. Finding the balance between accessibility and technical depth is definitely a challenge.

Even though I didnâ€™t solve this challenge during the actual CTF, I spent quite some time afterwards understanding it in detail â€” and used it as a great excuse to dive deeper into tools like `gdb`, `pwntools`, and **x86-64 internals**.

This was a really enjoyable challenge, and I look forward to tackling more like it soon.

Thanks for reading â€” hope you enjoyed the writeup. See you in the next one!
