## Overview 

This Python script allows you to input a list of keywords, generate corresponding variants based on your specifications, and search for them within a file. It then returns each line that matches any keyword or its generated variant. Additionally, it provides a summary showing the frequency of each keyword/variant’s appearance throughout the file.

The results are neatly organized in a summary table, which can be easily exported into several formats, such as `TXT`, `CSV`, or `JSON`. You’ll also have access to various filtering and visualization functionalities to refine your analysis.

This tool was developed following my participation in `irisCTF2025`, particularly after working on the `Windy Day` Forensics challenge. For a deeper dive into my process, feel free to check out [my writeup](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/irisctf2025-forensics-windy-day/). The source code for this script is available on my [Github](https://github.com/emree-1/tools/tree/main).

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS]
``` 
- `[SOURCE]` refers to the file/directory where the search will be performed.
- `[KEYWORDS]` specifies the list of keywords to search for.
- `[VARIANTS]` defines the types of variants you want to generate and search for.

By default, the script outputs a summary detailing how many times each keyword or variant appears and lists all the lines where a match is found.

Currently, the script supports generating the following variants:
- `Hexadecimal`,
- `Base64`,
- `Caesar Cipher`.  

If there are any other variants you'd like to see supported, feel free to let me know! I continuously add new variants as I encounter them in my CTF challenges and the need arises.

### Render

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] -r [RENDER]
``` 
- **Utility** : Specifies the format in which the output will be rendered.
- **Choices** : `[RENDER]` can be one of the following formats: `txt`, `csv`, `json` or `tab`.
- **Default** : The default output format is `csv`.

### Order

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] -o [ORDER] --inv_order
``` 
- **Utility** : Defines how the search results will be ordered based on specific parameters.
- **Choices** : The `[ORDER]` parameter can be one of `keyword`, `source`, or  , which will sort the results in ascending order. Use `--inv_order` to invert the order and sort in descending order.
- **Default** : By default there is no ordering.

> **Tip**
> Sorting by the `count` parameter is particularly useful when you want to see which keywords have the most matches. You can combine it with the `--inv_order` option to display results in descending order, making it easier to spot the most frequent matches.

### Parameters

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] -p [PARAMETERS]
``` 
- **Utility** : Specifies which parameters to extract or display from the search results.
- **Choices** : `[PARAMETERS]` can be one of the following: `keyword`, `source` or `count`.
- **Default** : By default, all parameters are extracted and displayed..

### Table format

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] --tblfmt [TABLE FORMAT]
``` 
- **Utility** : Changes the format in which the result table is rendered.
- **Choices** : See the [Tabulate documentation](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) for available table formats.
- **Default** : The default table format is `github`.

### Minimum & Maximum

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] --min [MIN] or --max [MAX]
``` 
- **Utility** : Filters the results based on the count of matches.
- **Default** : No filtering is applied by default.
  
### Cesar shifts

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] --cesar_shift [SHIFTS]
``` 
- **Utility** : Specifies the shifts to be applied when generating Caesar cipher variants.
- **Default** : If not specified, the script will apply all possible shifts for Caesar cipher variants, typically shifting by all 26 possible positions for the alphabet.

### Remove duplicates

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] --remove_duplicate
``` 
- **Utility** : Removes duplicate results from the output. If enabled, only the first occurrence of each result will be kept, reducing the length of the output.
- **Default** : This option is disabled by default. Enabling it may increase execution time due to additional processing.

### Case senstive

*Not implemented (yet)*

### Hide zero

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] --hide_zero
``` 
- **Utility** : Hides keywords or variants that do not have any matches in the search. This helps produce cleaner and shorter results, highlighting only relevant data.
- **Default** : By default, all keywords and variants, including those with zero matches, are displayed. 

### Other options

### Add index
```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] --index
``` 
- **Utility** : Adds an index column when exporting results in `CSV` or `JSON` formats, helping you track the results more easily.
- **Default** : The index is **not** included by default.

``` 
- **Utility** : Excludes the plain user-defined keywords from the search, so only the generated variants are considered.
- **Default** : By default, the plain user keywords are always included in the search.

### No space
```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] --no_space
``` 
- **Utility** : Removes leading and trailing spaces from the output. This is especially useful when redirecting results to a file or processing them in scripts.
- **Default** : By default, spaces are included in the output for better readability when displayed on the terminal.

### No summary
```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] --no_summary
``` 
- **Utility** : Disables the printing of the summary results at the end of the execution.
- **Default** : By default, the summary is printed after the search completes.

### Verbose

```bash
KeyFind.py [SOURCE] -k [KEYWORDS] -v [VARIANTS] --verbose
``` 
- **Utility** : Enables verbose mode, providing more detailed output during the script’s execution.
- **Default** : Verbose mode is not enabled by default.

- **Default** : By default, output is printed and the banner is displayed.
 
## Example

To illustrate how the script works, let's use a case I encountered during the [irisCTF2025 challenge, Windy Day](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/irisctf2025-forensics-windy-day/). After extracting strings from a Firefox process dump, I needed to search for the flag, which I knew started with `irisctf`.

Using my script, I was able to search for the flag quickly with the following command:

```bash
python3 KeyFind.py iris.txt -k irisctf -v user b64 --quiet
```

Output :
```
|     | keyword  | source        | count |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 0   | irisctf  | user          | 0     |
| 1   | aXJpc2N0 | b64 (irisctf) | 1320  |

Total : 1320
```

As we can see, there is no match for the plain `irisctf` keyword, but we found a match for its Base64 variant -`aXJpc2N0`- with 1320 occurrences. Now, let's refine the results by removing duplicates and excluding keywords with zero matches.

```bash
python3 KeyFind.py ../test/keyword.txt -k irisctf -v user b64 --quiet --remove_double --hide_zero
```

Output :  
```
|     | keyword  | source        | count |
| --- | -------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1   | aXJpc2N0 | b64 (irisctf) | 633   |

Total : 633
```

Now we have 633 occurrences of the Base64 variant, with duplicates removed and no zero matches. Next, we’ll extract the matching lines into a `CSV` file for further analysis using other tools. Since we only need the matching lines, we’ll only extract the `result` parameter:

```bash
python3 KeyFind.py ../test/keyword.txt -k irisctf -v user b64  -p result -r csv -e  ../out/keyfind.csv  --quiet --remove_double --hide_zero
```

CSV Output :
```
#
aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2FuX2lkaW90X3dpdGhfYmFkX21lbW9yeX0=
aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2FuX2lkaW90X3dpdGhfYmFkX21l
client=firefox-b-d&q=aXJpc2N0Z
www.axjpc2n0z
...
```

This gives us the Base64-encoded strings that matched our search, which can now be analyzed further using other tools.

> **Tip**   
> If you identify that you're working with Base64-encoded values, I’ve created another script called [b64find](https://emree-1.github.io/posts/b64-find/). It simplifies the detection process and automates the decoding and extraction of Base64 values. You can find its source code on my [Github](https://github.com/emree-1/tools/tree/main).

## Future Improvements

I plan to add more modules and variant capabilities to make this script an even more powerful keyword searching tool. Some features I’m considering include case sensitivity, searching within directories (not just individual files), and integrating Levenshtein distance algorithms to account for approximate string matching. Stay tuned for future updates!

## Conclusion

This script allows you to quickly search for a keyword and its various possible variants. As I mentioned, this is a tool that I plan to continuously develop, adding new modules and functionalities as I encounter different use cases.

I hope you find it useful, and that the guide was clear enough to get you started. See you in the next one!
