**Flag : L3AK{you_are_not_gonna_guess_me}**

## Ressources

For this challenge we were given an ELF binary file that we will have -as the category name suggests- reverse to get the flag. 

## Tools 

I used Binary ninja during the Challenge to dissasemble the binary, but eqauivalents such as Ghidra or even IDA would suit perfectly. Actually, you don't need anything more for this challenge. 

## Resolution

### Initial Analysis 

So first, we take a quick look at the file just to understand to little bit what it is about using th `file` command : 

```bash
babyrev: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, 
BuildID[sha1]=d30e77a25a8571ad0c6f336287fe9ce74ea9bb7c, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

As we were expecting it is an ELF file (Executable Linux Format). We have some more information about its linking, used interpreter and so on but we won't need as we won't need to pawn the binary. But we see that the binary is not stripped, which is really nice as it basically means that we will acess to function and global variable names as they were originally defined by the programmer, which makes the reversing project much easier. 

### Dynamic Analysis

Before diving into the code, I would to see what the binary actually does, so I will execute it and look at this behaviour. 

![Screenshot ot the dynamic analysis showing that for each attempt the program returns "Wrong flag. Try harder".](/assets/img/l3akctf/rev/babyrev/dynamic_analysis.png){: w="280"}

Ok so basically, the program is expecting from us a flag, which is actually a typical behaviour in reverse challenges.

### Static Analysis

#### `main()` function

Now it's time to look at some code ! And we launch the binary in Binary to see what it actually does. Here is the `main()` function decompiled by Binary Ninja that welcomes us : 


```c
undefined8 main(void) {
  int iVar1;
  time_t tVar2;
  size_t __n;
  int local_c;
  tVar2 = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand((uint)tVar2);

  init_remap();
  signal(2,sigint_handler);

  printf("Enter flag: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  fgets(input,0x40,stdin);

  for (local_c = 0; input[local_c] != '\0'; local_c = local_c + 1) {
    if (-1 < (char)input[local_c]) {
      input[local_c] = remap[(int)(uint)(byte)input[local_c]];
    }
  }
  __n = strlen(flag);
  iVar1 = strncmp(input,flag,__n);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("Correct! Here is your prize.");
  }
  else {
    puts("Wrong flag. Try harder.");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

First thing that catch ours attention is the use of the function `strncomp()` used to compare two strings, one named `input`, and the other looking like the flag we are looking for, interesting...

But you try this value it will actually not work as there an upper layer that we have to unveal to discover the actual flag. 

Now if look at what this function is actually doing, we can summarize it this way : 
1. Intialising some local variables.
2. Calling a function named `init_remap()`, we will certainly have to look a it right after...
3. Get a user input of maximum `64` bytes (`0x40`).
4. Loop on each element of the input string and replace them with a character from the variable `remap`. 
5. Compare if the modified user `input` is equal to the `flag` and display accordingly the result. 

We can do some quick cleaning to have a more easy to understand `main()` function now that we have a general idea of what it is doing :

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  // 1. Variables initialisation
  int is_input_equal_flag;
  time_t seed;
  size_t size_of_flag;
  int i;
  seed = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand((uint)seed);

  // 2. Call the init_remap() function
  init_remap();
  signal(2,sigint_handler);

  // 3. Get user input
  printf("Enter flag: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  fgets(input,0x40,stdin);

  // 4. Modify user input using remap
  for (i = 0; input[i] != '\0'; i = i + 1) {
    if (-1 < (char)input[i]) {
      input[i] = remap[(int)(uint)(byte)input[i]];
    }
  }

  // 5. Verify if modified user input equals flag
  size_of_flag = strlen(flag);
  is_input_equal_flag = strncmp(input,flag,size_of_flag);
  if (is_input_equal_flag == 0) {
    puts("Correct! Here is your prize.");
  }
  else {
    puts("Wrong flag. Try harder.");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

#### `init_remap()` function

To solve this challenge we now need to understand the modifications performed by the `init_remap()` function to our user input. And create an input that when modified will be equal to the flag. Here is cleaned version of this version. 

```c
void init_remap(void)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 0x80; i = i + 1) {
    remap[i] = (char)i;
  }

  remap[0x61] = 0x71;
  remap[0x62] = 0x77;
  remap[99] = 0x65;
  remap[100] = 0x72;
  remap[0x65] = 0x74;
  remap[0x66] = 0x79;
  remap[0x67] = 0x75;
  remap[0x68] = 0x69;
  remap[0x69] = 0x6f;
  remap[0x6a] = 0x70;
  remap[0x6b] = 0x61;
  remap[0x6c] = 0x73;
  remap[0x6d] = 100;
  remap[0x6e] = 0x66;
  remap[0x6f] = 0x67;
  remap[0x70] = 0x68;
  remap[0x71] = 0x6a;
  remap[0x72] = 0x6b;
  remap[0x73] = 0x6c;
  remap[0x74] = 0x7a;
  remap[0x75] = 0x78;
  remap[0x76] = 99;
  remap[0x77] = 0x76;
  remap[0x78] = 0x62;
  remap[0x79] = 0x6e;
  remap[0x7a] = 0x6d;
  return;
}
```
Basically it is the function that is allocating the values of the `remap` variable. The allocation is linear between the index number and the ASCII value, except for elements from index `0x61` (97) to `0x7a` (122) which corresponds to the ASCII number from `a` to `z`.  

The `remap` is actually defining a substitution table for each cacter, let's look at some examples : 
```c
  remap[0x61] = 0x71; // remap["a"] = "q" -> "a" becomes "q"
  remap[0x62] = 0x77; // remap["b"] = "w" -> "b" becomes "w"
  remap[99] = 0x65; // remap["c"] = "e" -> "c" becomes "e"
  ...
```
If you look further, it actually reverse the alphabet order by the order of the a qwerty keyboard.

### Script to reverse remap

Now that we know the transformation made by `init_remap()`, we can create a python script that will reverse the used substitution process and we will apply to the content of the hidden flag. Here is a script doing that : 

```py
ciphertext = "ngx_qkt_fgz_ugffq_uxtll_dt"

alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
qwerty_order ="qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm"
substitution_table = {qwerty_order[i]: alphabet[i] for i in range(len(alphabet))}

flag = "".join(substitution_table.get(c, c) for c in ciphertext)
print(f"Flag : {flag}")
```

And this is how you can obtain the flag !
```bash
Flag : you_are_not_gonna_guess_me
```

## Conclusion

It has been long time I haven't shared anything on this site, I was quite busy looking for an internship for my last year of uni and j'ai mis de côté ctfs. But hopefully I should be back !

Anyways, I really liked this chall even if I'm sure it is a very easy reverse challenge. I'm not familiar at all with this subtopic but I really liked it, looking forward to do more rev !

Thank you for reading my write-up! See you in the next one!
