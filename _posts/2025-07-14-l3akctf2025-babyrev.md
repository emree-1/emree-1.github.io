**Flag : L3AK{you_are_not_gonna_guess_me}**

## Ressources

For this challenge, we were given a **64-bit ELF binary** that—as the category name suggests—requires reversing to retrieve the flag.

## Tools 

I used `Ghidra` for disassembly and static analysis throughout this challenge. Alternatives like `Binary Ninja` or `IDA Pro` would also work perfectly. In fact, no additional tools are strictly necessary; everything required to solve the challenge can be done within your favorite disassembler.

## Walkthrough

### Initial Analysis 

We start by performing a quick inspection of the binary using the `file` command:

```bash
$ file babyrev

babyrev: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, 
BuildID[sha1]=d30e77a25a8571ad0c6f336287fe9ce74ea9bb7c, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

As expected, this is a **64-bit ELF file** targeting the x86-64 architecture. It's **dynamically linked** and built for GNU/Linux. One key detail: the binary is **not stripped**—which is excellent news. This means that function names and global variables have been preserved, making the reverse engineering process much easier.

### Dynamic Analysis

Before diving into the static analysis, let's observe the program's behavior by simply running it:

![Screenshot showing that for each attempt the program returns "Wrong flag. Try harder".](/assets/img/l3akctf/rev/babyrev/dynamic_analysis.png){: w="280"}

As we can see, the binary prompts us for a flag and returns “*Wrong flag. Try harder*.” on incorrect input. Classic reverse engineering challenge behavior.

### Static Analysis

#### main() function

Now it's time to dig into the code. Opening the binary in `Ghidra`, here’s the decompiled `main()` function:

```c
undefined8 main(void) {
  int iVar1;
  time_t tVar2;
  size_t __n;
  int local_c;
  tVar2 = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand((uint)tVar2);

  init_remap();
  signal(2,sigint_handler);

  printf("Enter flag: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  fgets(input,0x40,stdin);

  for (local_c = 0; input[local_c] != '\0'; local_c = local_c + 1) {
    if (-1 < (char)input[local_c]) {
      input[local_c] = remap[(int)(uint)(byte)input[local_c]];
    }
  }
  __n = strlen(flag);
  iVar1 = strncmp(input,flag,__n);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("Correct! Here is your prize.");
  }
  else {
    puts("Wrong flag. Try harder.");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Here’s what the program is doing, step by step:
1. **Seeds the RNG** with the current timestamp using `srand(time(NULL))`. This suggests a possible time-dependence, but as we’ll see, it’s not directly relevant to the flag.
2. Calls `init_remap()`, which likely **initializes the remap table** used later.
3. **Sets up a signal handler** for `SIGINT`, though this isn’t directly relevant for our solution path.
4. **Prompts the user for input** and reads up to 64 bytes via `fgets()`.
5. Iterates through the input and **replaces each character** with a **corresponding character** from a **remap array**, likely acting as a substitution cipher.
6. Compares the transformed input with a hardcoded flag using `strncmp()` and prints the result accordingly.

At this point, one might be tempted to try extracting the flag variable directly, but that won't work—because the comparison is done after transforming the user input using the remap table. In other words, the input is encoded, and the flag is the encoded version of the correct input.

Let’s now clean up and simplify our understanding of `main()`:

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  // 1. Variables initialisation
  int is_input_equal_flag;
  time_t seed;
  size_t size_of_flag;
  int i;
  seed = time((time_t *)0x0);
  srand((uint)seed);

  // 2. Call the init_remap() function
  init_remap();
  signal(2,sigint_handler);

  // 3. Get user input
  printf("Enter flag: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  fgets(input,0x40,stdin);

  // 4. Modify user input using remap
  for (i = 0; input[i] != '\0'; i = i + 1) {
    if (-1 < (char)input[i]) {
      input[i] = remap[(int)(uint)(byte)input[i]];
    }
  }

  // 5. Verify if modified user input equals flag
  size_of_flag = strlen(flag);
  is_input_equal_flag = strncmp(input,flag,size_of_flag);
  if (is_input_equal_flag == 0) {
    puts("Correct! Here is your prize.");
  }
  else {
    puts("Wrong flag. Try harder.");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

From this, the challenge becomes clearer: we need to **reverse the remapping process** to reconstruct the original flag input that, once encoded using remap, matches the hardcoded flag.

#### init_remap() function

To solve this challenge, we need to understand how the user input is transformed before being compared to the hardcoded flag. This transformation is defined in the `init_remap()` function, which sets up a substitution table called `remap`. Here's a cleaned-up version of that function:

```c
void init_remap(void)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 0x80; i = i + 1) {
    remap[i] = (char)i;
  }

  remap[0x61] = 0x71;
  remap[0x62] = 0x77;
  remap[99] = 0x65;
  remap[100] = 0x72;
  remap[0x65] = 0x74;
  remap[0x66] = 0x79;
  remap[0x67] = 0x75;
  remap[0x68] = 0x69;
  remap[0x69] = 0x6f;
  remap[0x6a] = 0x70;
  remap[0x6b] = 0x61;
  remap[0x6c] = 0x73;
  remap[0x6d] = 100;
  remap[0x6e] = 0x66;
  remap[0x6f] = 0x67;
  remap[0x70] = 0x68;
  remap[0x71] = 0x6a;
  remap[0x72] = 0x6b;
  remap[0x73] = 0x6c;
  remap[0x74] = 0x7a;
  remap[0x75] = 0x78;
  remap[0x76] = 99;
  remap[0x77] = 0x76;
  remap[0x78] = 0x62;
  remap[0x79] = 0x6e;
  remap[0x7a] = 0x6d;
  return;
}
```

The function starts by initializing `remap[i] = i` for all values from `0x00` to `0x7F`, effectively creating an identity mapping. Then, it **redefines mappings for lowercase ASCII characters** `a` to `z` (from `97` to `122`). These values are substituted using a hardcoded mapping that corresponds to the **QWERTY keyboard layout**.

In other words, the function defines a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher, replacing each lowercase letter with the letter found in the same position on a QWERTY keyboard:

```c
  remap[0x61] = 0x71; // remap["a"] = "q" -> "a" becomes "q"
  remap[0x62] = 0x77; // remap["b"] = "w" -> "b" becomes "w"
  remap[99] = 0x65; // remap["c"] = "e" -> "c" becomes "e"
  ...
```

This means that to reverse the process, we just need to **invert this substitution**: for each character in the transformed flag, we substitute it with the letter that maps to it in the remap array.

### Script to reverse remap

Now that we understand the transformation, let’s write a Python script to reverse it and retrieve the original user input that, after remapping, would match the encoded flag:

```py
ciphertext = "ngx_qkt_fgz_ugffq_uxtll_dt"
qwerty = "qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm"
alpha = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

remap = dict(zip(qwerty, alpha))
flag = ''.join(remap.get(c, c) for c in ciphertext)
print("Flag:", flag)
```

Running this gives us:

```bash
Flag : you_are_not_gonna_guess_me
```

And just like that, we have our flag!

## Conclusion

It had been a while since I posted a write-up—I've been pretty busy searching for an internship for the final year of my degree, which put CTFs on hold for a bit. **But I’m finally getting back into it**!

This challenge was categorized as beginner-friendly, but I genuinely enjoyed it. Although I don’t usually focus on reverse engineering, this challenge was a great way to ease into it.

Thanks for reading — hope you enjoyed the writeup. See you in the next one!
